## use an elevator

- at bank of elevators, take note of current floor
- subtract desired floor from current floor
- if result is negative, hit top button to call a rising elevator
- if result was positive, hit bottom button to call a descending elevator.
- when an elevator arrives, 
    + check that illuminated indicator matches desired direction of travel
    + if it is going in the right direction, navigate into the elevator 
    + rotate 180 degrees to face the doors 
- to direct the elevator to the correct floor, first locate the array of buttons
    + look to the left for an array of buttons. 
        + if found, navigate to face the buttons
    + else, look to the right, locate the buttons, and navigate to face them
    + else, [...] #TODO write instructions for newfangled elevators with no buttons in them
- select the correct floor
    + beginning at the top of the array of buttons, scan left-to-right and downwards until the button is located that displays numerical character sequence matching the number of the target floor
    + depress the button with sufficient force to cause it to illuminate
- while doors are closed, stand still and wait.
- when doors open, 
    + locate floor indicator near top of elevator doors
    + if indicated current floor matches the target floor
        * navigate out of the elevator
    + else
        * wait for doors to close and reopen

## practicing drum assignments

- collect drumpad, sticks, assignment sheet, metronome, timer
- set timer for 30 minutes and begin countdown
- until timer has sounded, execute assignments as follows:
    + scan assignment sheet from top until an uncompleted assignment is found
    + read the assignment and tap out the rhythm slowly until the assignment is understood
    + choose a starting tempo for appropriate tempo
    + set the metronome to appropriate tempo, then:
        * attempt to perform the assignment to the beat of the metronome
        * while correct completions < 8
            - if the assignment is completed correctly, begin again immediately and increment count of correct completions by one
            - else if frustration is above comfort threshhold
                + if the current tempo is the starting tempo, lower metronome speed and restart assignment
                + else if the tempo is faster than starting tempo, mark assignment completed and begin next assignment
            - else reset count to zero, wait for the beat, and attempt again.
        * choose a faster tempo for appropriate tempo
- return drumpad, sticks, assignment sheet, metronome, timer to proper storage places.
