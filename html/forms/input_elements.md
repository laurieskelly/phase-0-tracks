# Exploring a form

### Input types

* `<fieldset>`: Separates one part of the form from another; groups input elements together
* `<input type="text">`: A short box for entering a small amount of text
* `<input type="email">`: Looks like a textbox but is automatically checked so that the input sting is not accepted if it is not in the format of an email
* `<input type="password">`: Also looks like a textbox but the input string is obscured with dots as it is entered
* `<select>`: Gives a list of pre-created elements for the user to choose from
* `<input type="date">`: User can type in a date (must be valid), or use the ui elements (arrow buttons, drop down calendar) to select the date in other ways
* `<input type="checkbox">`: An item with a "yes/no" (true/false; boolean) value can be input with a checkbox input element
* `<button type="Submit>`: Submit button sends the form after fields have been validated.
